**USER INSTRUCTIONS:**
On running the program, you will see four empty 4x4 grids. Each grid represents a layer of a cube, so the four grids together make one cube. The object is to be the first to get four in a row in any direction, including across layers of the cube. The program tells you when it is X's turn and O's turn, and when someone has achieved four in a row.
